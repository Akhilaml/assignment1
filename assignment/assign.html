    <p><strong>To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never see themselves, by having knowledge of them that they can never have; it turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed. Just as a camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a subliminal murder - a soft murder, appropriate to a sad, frightened time.</p>
    <p><strong>Photography is a powerful and expressive art form that transcends cultural boundaries, capturing moments in time with a unique blend of technical skill and creative vision. Through the lens of a camera, photographers have the ability to freeze fleeting moments, telling stories, evoking emotions, and preserving memories. </p>
